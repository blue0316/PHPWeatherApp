# PHPWeatherApp
Created whilst following "Complete Web Developer Course 2.0", Section 8: PHP and Section 10: APIs by Rob Percival. Original version made by scraping from https://www.weather-forecast.com. Current version uses Open Weather API (https://openweathermap.org/). Some changes were made to the tutorial for mobile compatibility, and error checking.
